# ExerShare
## Inspiration
During quarantine, many people, including us, utilized the extra time to improve themselves, whether it be physically and mentally. For around a year now, we have developed an interest in working out, as it provides a healthy outlet for us to escape the stress of our college life and the pandemic, while also allowing us to improve our own self images. We felt that creating a social media to allow people to share workouts with each other would be really beneficial for us, as well as the many others who want to get into working out, but do not necessarily know where to start. Another reason for us to develop this app is that we realized that many people also felt a decline in their mental health. As result, ExerShare offers a platform for people to share mental health workouts. Through ExerShare, we want to share our interest in working out and mental health with the world.

## The Design
There are two feeds on ExerShare: a physical workout feed, which showcases posts detailing traditional workouts and a mental health feed where people can post yoga exercises, meditation, or general updates about their lives. Each feed also has a search bar that allows users to search for specific workouts, exercises, and weights. Users can like, unlike, save, and comment on posts, as well as can see their own posts on their profile page. Clicking on a post will allow you to see the full contents of the post, as well as allow you to comment on it; it works very similar to the Reddit interface. 

## The Process
We utilized AndroidStudio and Java to develop ExerShare.

## Challenges
This was our first app that anyone of us have ever made, so learning how to combine our knowledge of Java with the Android components was definitely a challenge. Our biggest struggle was probably trying to get the Post objects we coded in Java to combine with the xml layouts.

## Accomplishments
As mentioned above, we had trouble getting our Post objects to display, but when we got it to work it was a huge relief. And obviously, we are proud that we were able to develop an app in AndroidStudio.

## What we learned
We learned how to code in AndroidStudio, understand how user input works, and learn how to effectively divide up our tasks and manage our time.

## Future Developments
We would like to develop a Recommended Feed that utilizes posts you have liked to customize your feed to you liking. We would also like to include a Following feature, so that you can follow other peoples' posts.
